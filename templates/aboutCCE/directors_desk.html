          The idea of Christ College of Engineering was born out of the
          aspirations of locals from different strata of society who felt the
          need for a world-class institution offering professional education in
          the mini education hub called Irinjalakuda. Bearing in mind the then
          prevailing scenario in the Engineering Education sector, with a giant
          leap of faith, this college was established in 2015. Today, by God’s
          grace and due to the efforts put in by all the stakeholders, we are
          scripting success stories one after another.
          <br />
          <br />
          Successful engineering careers don’t happen by chance. We believe that
          success comes to those who work hard and stays with those who do not
          rest on their past laurels. This is the mantra we regularly ingrain in
          our students. We too, as an institution, follow the same path. As we
          continue in our pursuit of excellence, we constantly remind ourselves
          that excellence is not an act, but a habit. It should be like second
          nature to us.
          <br />
          <br />
          At Christ College of Engineering, we are committed to providing our
          students with the right platform to launch themselves into a fruitful
          and rewarding future. With the kind of transformative learning model
          we have in place here, coupled with the collaborative and harmonious
          co-existence of all stakeholders, we intend to positively shape the
          minds of the global citizens of tomorrow. Do you want your success
          story to start taking shape here? Well then, come and join Christ
          College of Engineering.
