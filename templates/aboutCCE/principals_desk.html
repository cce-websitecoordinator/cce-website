                    born out of the aspirations of locals from different strata of society who felt the need for a
                    world-class institution offering professional education in the mini education hub called
                    Irinjalakuda. Today Christ College of Engineering is well on its way to becoming a much sought-after

                    <p>Today the role of a professional education provider is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower its students to be lifelong learners. Learning is the process of constantly updating in an ever changing world. The tremendous recent changes in the current global scenario present both challenges and opportunities in the engineering education.</p>

                    <p>Within a short span of time, Christ College of Engineering that is being managed by Christ Educational and Charitable Trust has earned its own niche among the engineering colleges under APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University. Here we provide an atmosphere to our students for multifaceted development, where they are encouraged to channelize their potential in the pursuit of a bright career.</p>

                    <p>Excellence, in both academic and co-curricular aspects is an integral value of education that we offer to our students. We inculcate social values and social awareness through a variety of academic, co-curricular and extracurricular activities. We strongly encourage students to participate in these activities and showcase their talents. </p>

                    <p>I sincerely wish each student at CCE a very happy and academically highly rewarding student life and hope that their accomplishments will enhance the pride and prestige of our Institution.</p>
